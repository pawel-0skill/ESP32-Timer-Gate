Project idea - use a set of two ESP32 boards and VL53L0 ToF sensors as timing gates for agility courses, communicating with a third ESP32 board over ESP-NOW, itself communication with a PC over USB.
Related repo - ESP32-Timer-Comm, to be done.
Related repo - ESP32-Timer-GUI, to be done.

Steps:
1. 0% - learn interrupts
2. 0% - re-learn VL53L0
3. 0% - learn ESP-NOW
4. 0% - write code for the PC interface board
5. 0% - write code for a time keeping program for the PC
